A talk about the Turing award lecture "Reflections on Trusting Trust" originally given by Ken Thompson. This talk was given in [Gophercon Singapore 2018](https://2018.gophercon.sg)

Demo Go programs are in the `codes` directory. My slides and talk video are available in the picture links below.

There are some SHA-256 checksum values used in my presentation. These values are dependent on the binaries generated by a specific compiler version which may change over time. The following shows the compiler version running on my macOS Sierra.

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.10.1 darwin/amd64
```
